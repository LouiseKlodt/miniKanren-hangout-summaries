## Recaps of Prior Hangouts
### Advanced (2017-04-02)
* Youtube link
* ~3-40 minutes, Michael1 asks if it might be possible to use mk to facilitate network configuration.  Various attempts are made to formulate more precisely what this might mean
  * Related Links: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/frenetic-netkat.pdf
* ~40-80 minutes, Will describes a tricky problem with the current Barliman, in which the user has made a "clear" mistake, Barliman, instead of complaining, cleverly finds a way to code around the issue -- not necessarily the message one want to put across in a pedagogic setting.
* ~80-end, Michael2 presents a few diagrams that help visualize how mk progresses through the search space.  Nehal gives this "two thumbs up!"
  * Related Links: Rose asks Michael2 where in the mk implementation this search behavior is created, Michael2 says look here:
    * https://github.com/miniKanren/simple-miniKanren/blob/master/mk.scm#L201 
    * https://github.com/miniKanren/simple-miniKanren/blob/master/mk.scm#L178

## Meta
* Meta will be moved elsewhere
* You are encouraged to ask for push permission.  If you are considering following this repo, just ask for push bits instead. 
* Just scaffold out content.  Either you or someone else will fill in the details / cleanup typos later. 
* If you like, make edits directly via the github webpage interface.
* Add the newest recaps at the top of the list 
* Add annotations of any other mk videos/events, not just the hangous e.g. clojure conferences etc. 
* Thanks!
